We start by talking about technology ethics, and we discuss arguments for and against technology being neutral. We discuss what is a tool, and if scientific discoveries are value-free. We talk about design bias, and the example of policing. We discuss the problem with sci-fi fiction, existential risks, and distracting from real threats. We talk about social media, clickbait, misinformation, online privacy, data collection, and regulation. Finally, we discuss digital health tools used during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if they were worth it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> Technology ethics  \n<time>06:24</time> Is technology neutral?  \n<time>15:30</time> What is a tool?  \n<time>32:55</time> Are scientific discoveries value-free?  \n<time>39:17</time> Design bias, and the example of policing  \n<time>52:01</time> The problem with sci-fi fiction, existential risks, and distracting from real problems  \n<time>1:05:27</time> Social media, clickbait, and misinformation  \n<time>1:11:40</time> Online privacy, data collection, and regulation  \n<time>1:22:53</time> Digital health tools for the COVID-19 pandemic  \n<time>1:36:30</time> Follow Dr. Hare\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hare\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3lE48JV  \nTechnology Is Not Neutral: https://bit.ly/3K0csgj  \nTwitter handle: @hare_brain\n",
