	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 15th 2023.  \nDr. Nicholas Brown is a Researcher at Linnaeus University, Sweden. He works on developing new research methods in psychology and on applying meta-scientific perspectives on psychology as a science.\n\nIn this episode, we start by discussing conceptual and methodological issues with positive psychology and the study of well-being, and go through critiques of Lyubomirsky\u2019s \u201chappiness pie\u201d, and happiness surveys. We also address methodological flaws with studies on the link between genetics and well-being, sadness and color perception, and predicting heart disease from Twitter language. We then discuss where bad science stems from, and talk about incentives, issues with the publishing system, and how bad science goes unchecked. Finally, we talk about the idea of trusting the experts, and rules of thumb to evaluate scientific evidence.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:58</time> Conceptual and methodological issues with positive psychology and the study of well-being  \n<time>11:50</time> Lyubomirsky\u2019s \u201chappiness pie\u201d  \n<time>18:57</time> Happiness surveys  \n<time>39:03</time> Genetics and well-being  \n<time>46:33</time> Sadness and color perception  \n<time>48:49</time> Twitter language and predicting heart disease  \n<time>56:43</time> The incentives behind bad science  \n<time>1:05:19</time> Issues with the publishing system  \n<time>1:12:00</time> How bad science goes unchecked  \n<time>1:25:28</time> Is there much that individual people can do?  \n<time>1:34:07</time> Trusting the experts  \n<time>1:48:54</time> Rules of thumb to evaluate scientific evidence  \n<time>1:58:42</time> Follow Dr. Brown\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Brown\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3OrT8eq  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3OpxvuX\n\nReferenced papers:  \nLyubomirsky et al.: https://bit.ly/3SHXzUN  \nFredrickson et al.: https://bit.ly/3QGoQUZ  \nThorstenson, Pazda, and Elliot: https://bit.ly/3R2fuo5  \nEichstaedt et al.: https://bit.ly/3QDXaAa\n",
